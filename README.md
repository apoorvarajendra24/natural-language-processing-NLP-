# 🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Journey

Welcome to my NLP learning repository! 🌟  
Here, I share everything I’m learning as I explore the fascinating world of Natural Language Processing — from the basics to real-world applications. 🚀

## 📚 What's Inside?

- 📝 **Text Preprocessing**  
  Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stopword removal, and more.

- 🧾 **Part-of-Speech Tagging**  
  Understanding word categories with NLTK & spaCy.

- 🧠 **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**  
  Identifying people, places, and organizations in text.

- 🧪 **Regular Expressions in NLP**  
  Pattern matching and text cleaning.

- 🔍 **Topic Modeling**  
  Discovering hidden themes in text using LDA.

- 🤖 **NLP with Machine Learning**  
  Using scikit-learn for text classification and clustering.

- 🧰 **Tools & Libraries**  
  NLTK, spaCy, Gensim, Scikit-learn, and more.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo is meant to document my learning, experiments, and mini-projects in NLP. It will grow over time as I explore more concepts and apply them in real-world scenarios. 🌱

## 💡 Contributions

This is a personal learning repo, but suggestions and improvements are always welcome! 😊

## 📌 Note

Some notebooks or scripts may require you to download additional resources (like `punkt` for tokenization in NLTK).  
Please check the comments in each script for guidance or the info.txt file.
